# marvel-character-finder

## Project Description
The Marvel Character Finder is an interactive web application that allows Marvel fans to search their favortie characters and get a detailed profile of the character including description, image, and link to the comic books and series in which the character appears. The application also returns popular movies that the character may appear or feature in with posters and synopses. Fans can return to the search landing page and see a menu of their last five character searches.

## Application Details
This application uses a CSS framework called [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), which can be composed directly in the markup. The user interface is designed to be interactive, such that the user can enter a character name and return data from two server-side APIs: [The Marvel Comics API](https://developer.marvel.com/) which returns comic book information about the character and [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) which returns popular movies with the character if any were produced. The application also utilizes client-side storage to store persistent data so that users can come back to the page and see their recent searches.

The UI is designed to be responsive to different device display widths and have a clean, modern, and minimal appearance.

Source code is provided publicly on GitHub and meets quality coding standards.
